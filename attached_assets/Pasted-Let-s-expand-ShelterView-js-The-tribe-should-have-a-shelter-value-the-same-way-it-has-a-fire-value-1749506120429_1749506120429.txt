Let's expand ShelterView.js 

The tribe should have a shelter value the same way it has a fire value. Day 1 begins with shelter=0 for the player tribe and the opposing NPC tribe(s) and they also begin with fire=0. 

When ShelterView loads it should check the current player tribe's shelter value and adjust the background accordingly. 0 shelter shows shelter0.jpeg, 1 shows shelter1.jpeg, and so on through shelter=5. 

The action bar should have a center button just like the campfire view. The center button, when pressed, will check shelter value and bamboo and palms value of the player. If shelter=0 and bamboo and palms are less than 1, a parchment will appear saying "Before building a structure, you must gather 1 bamboo and 1 palm frond." Nothing else will happen. If shelter=1-3, it says “Before continuing work on the shelter, you must gather 1 bamboo and 1 palm frond.” If shelter=4, it says “You must have a luxury item to enhance your shelter further.” If shelter=5, it says “This place can’t get much better.” Regardless, nothing else happens. 

If shelter=0 through 3, and palms and bamboo are 1 or more, a parchment will appear saying. "A good way to gain favor with the tribe is to help build a strong shelter. However, it's also physically demanding and can take time." Then there should be a line break before the next sentence "Choose a tribe mate to join you in shelter building. " Clicking anywhere will close the parchment popup and load the Choose a Co-Builder popup which will use a different background image depending on player tribe's color. I have blue-banner.png, red-banner.png, same for green, purple, and orange, in Assets/Tribe/ so load the proper color for the player tribe. Overlayed on top of the image will be a grid of each survivor (EXCLUDING the player) avatar. The grid should be just like the one on TribeFlagView.js, in circle shape with the survivor name below and “Physical: X” with the survivor’s respective physical value displayed. 

Clicking a survivor avatar will load a popup again using the correct color banner image for the background with the selected survivor's avatar centered with the words Choose Ozzy? Or whichever name the selected survivor has, and two buttons using rect-button.small that say "Confirm" and "Cancel". Cancel will go back to the grid of tribe mates. Selecting Confirm will select that tribe mate as co-builder and close the grid popup. Now, two buttons should be above the action bar towards the bottom. These buttons are identical to the coconut and fish buttons in the cooking interface in FireView, except one will have the bamboo.png image and the other will have palm.png, both in Assets/Resources/ 

Clicking the resource will open an identical popup to the "Add to pot" ingredient popup from the cooking interface in FireView except it will say simply "Add Bamboo" or "Add Palm Fronds". It will only allow the required amount to be added (1). Once both are added, a button should appear in the center of the screen using rect-button-1 with rect-button.alt styling. The text should say "Start Building". 

Clicking Start Building will display a parchment saying "Based on your and (the name of the co-builder)’s Physical values, construction took X minutes.” Replace X with however much time is deducted from the clock. Formulate how long it takes based on the physical value of the player and the co-builder. Less physical takes longer. More physical takes shorter. Analyze every survivor’s physical value in GameData and find a way to calculate it. It should take no longer than 20 in game minutes and no shorter than 5 in game minutes. Remember the game clock timer ticks downward. So this number is directly tied to the timer clock and will deduct the correct amount of minutes and make the numbers flash red like they do in other views. Also, the player and the co-builder will each gain 10 teamPlayer points. Ensure that one +10 teamPlayer animation shows like it does on WaterWell and other views. When Start Building is clicked, also change the shelter value up a digit (example from shelter=0 to shelter=1) and change the background to reflect. 

Make sure to import all relevant GameData and other things the same way we do in other views like FireView, WaterWellView, FishingView, TribeFlagView, etc.
