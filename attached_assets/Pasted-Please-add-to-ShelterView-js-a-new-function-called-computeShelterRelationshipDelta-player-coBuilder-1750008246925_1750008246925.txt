Please add to ShelterView.js a new function called computeShelterRelationshipDelta(player, coBuilder, actualBuildTime, expectedBuildTime) that returns a signed integer between –5 and +5. Follow this algorithm:

1. **Performance Factor**  
   - Calculate `performanceFactor = expectedBuildTime / actualBuildTime`.  
   - This yields >1.0 for faster-than-expected builds, <1.0 for slower.

2. **Style Compatibility**  
   - Define a lookup table named `styleCompat` where keys are `"playerStyle|coStyle"` strings and values are multipliers (e.g. 1.2 for very compatible, 0.8 for clashing).  
   - Retrieve `styleFactor = styleCompat[\`\${player.gameplayStyle}|\${coBuilder.gameplayStyle}\`]` or default to 1.0.

3. **Physical Balance**  
   - Compute absolute gap: `physGap = Math.abs(player.physical - coBuilder.physical)`.  
   - Let `maxPhysical = 100`.  
   - Set `physicalFactor = 1 - (physGap / maxPhysical) * 0.5`.

4. **Personality Harmony**  
   - Normalize and average the three stats:  
     ```
     avgTeam   = (player.teamPlayer   + coBuilder.teamPlayer)   / 200;
     avgSocial = (player.social       + coBuilder.social)       / 200;
     avgMental = (player.mental       + coBuilder.mental)       / 200;
     harmonyFactor = (avgTeam + avgSocial + avgMental) / 3;
     ```

5. **Stress / Suspicion Penalty**  
   - Compute averages:  
     ```
     threatAvg = (player.threat + coBuilder.threat) / 2 / 100;
     healthAvg = (player.health + coBuilder.health) / 2 / 100;
     stressFactor = 1
       - (threatAvg * 0.3)               // up to –30% if threat is max
       - ((1 - healthAvg) * 0.2);        // up to –20% if health is zero
     ```

6. **Random Jitter**  
   - `randomJitter = 1 + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1`  // ±5%

7. **Base Change**  
   - `baseChange = performanceFactor > 1 ? +2 : -2`

8. **Combine & Clamp**  
   - Multiply all factors:  
     ```
     rawDelta = baseChange
       * performanceFactor
       * styleFactor
       * physicalFactor
       * harmonyFactor
       * stressFactor
       * randomJitter;
     ```  
   - Round: `delta = Math.round(rawDelta)`  
   - Clamp:  
     ```
     delta = Math.max(-5, Math.min(5, delta));
     ```  
   - Return `delta`.

Have it apply `delta` to both `player.relationships[coBuilder.id]` and `coBuilder.relationships[player.id]` immediately after the build completes.
